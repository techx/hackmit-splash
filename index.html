                                    If you’re travelling more than 30 miles to MIT, we’ll reimburse your travel, as long as you upload your travel receipts upon confirming your attendance. We reimburse up to $200 for travel within the U.S. and from Canada and Mexico and up to $500 for other international travel. We also provide buses free of charge to select East Coast cities.

                                    Teams are at most 4 people. You can select teammates when you register, or you can register individually without specified teammates. We’ll run the lottery by teams, so rest assured you’ll be able to hack with your friends if that’s what you prefer!

                                    We created factions to encourage hackers to have fun and interact with each other outside of normal teams when you’re not working on your projects.  The Red Faction and Blue Faction are hackathon-wide groups  that collectively complete challenges at HackMIT 2017 for points.  The faction with the most points will win and get a surprise upon the conclusion of the hackathon.
